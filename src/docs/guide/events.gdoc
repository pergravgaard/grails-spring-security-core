Spring Security fires application events after various security-related actions such as successful login, unsuccessful login, and so on. Spring Security uses two main event classes, [AbstractAuthenticationEvent|https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/authentication/event/AbstractAuthenticationEvent.html] and [AbstractAuthorizationEvent|https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/access/event/AbstractAuthorizationEvent.html].
